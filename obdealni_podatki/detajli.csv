Art, literature, cinema and music were thriving in France’s capital and these creative minds also fell in love with France’s iconic wines. 
Les Dauphins is crafted by a small network of family winemakers from the Dauphiné region of the Rhône Valley who joined forces to make delicious wines that fueled the creative revolution in bistros across Paris. The Dauphiné supplied countless Parisian restaurants, and became extremely popular thanks to the exuberance and versatility of their wines, which paired beautifully with classic French bistro dishes. Today, Les Dauphins continues to uphold this legacy of excitement and creativity with their fabulous portfolio of excellent red, white and rosé wines from vineyards in the Southern Rhône. Headed up by talented winemaker Guillaume Valli, Les Dauphins favors those traditional grape varieties that have inspired palates for generations; Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The result?

The cool-climate vineyard site combined with gentle handling at every stage is central to

These heritage Martini clone vines were planted at Hawkeye Ranch in the 1970s by the
Johnsons, the clone selected by the legendary Louis Martini himself, and now quite rare as
most of the older vines have been replanted. This clone thrives here, and the crop load and
vine vigor are naturally balanced, allowing for an organic farming style that promotes
slow, steady fruit maturation. This gives rise to wonderfully delicate, yet highly textured,
full-bodied wine.
The fruit was de-stemmed and the whole berries transferred to open-top fermentation
tanks to cold soak for seven days prior to native fermentation, which allows for delicate
extraction and adds complexity. Gentle extraction was ensured by performing
punchdowns to mix the must, and maintaining moderate temperatures throughout
fermentation. After fermentation, the wine was pressed and sent to barrel, where native
malolactic fermentation was encouraged (by stirring and keeping them cozy). The wine
aged in ~20% new French oak barrels, with the balance in neutral French oak barrels. To
enhance palate weight and mouthfeel, the wine was left in contact with light lees and
gently stirred.
The wine was aged for 12 months in barrel and then receives an additional 12 months of
bottle age before initial release."" -Importer

120338,Mosel,Mosel,White,7.5,Cork,"Today, Johannes Selbach and his wife Barbara, with the increasing help of son Sebastian and daughter Hannah, manage their vineyards and winery with passion and respect for the estate’s long held traditions. 55% of their 24 hectares of vines are on their original rootstocks, in Zeltinger Himmelreich, Schlossberg, and Sonnenuhr; Wehlener Sonnenuhr; and, Graacher Himmelreich and Domprobst. These vineyards of weathered Devonian slate are on a steep, contiguous slope facing south-south west and represent some of the most prestigious sites in all of the Middle Mosel, in fact 85% of the Selbach’s vines are on steep slopes. The Selbach family’s heritage in the wine business dates to 1660: Selbach’s ancestors shipped wines down the Mosel in their own ships, the wine carried in oak barrels made by cooper Matthias Oster, the great-grandfather on the paternal side of the family. Thus, the winery developed as both a top estate producing some of the region’s best wine, and also as a négociant and brokerage firm, consolidating the production of smaller growers. The hallmark of the estate are 3 old parcels that Selbach-Oster harvests en-bloc; or, as single pickings, with no selections pulled from the vineyard prior to harvesting. The Rotlay (in the Zeltingen Sonnenuhr, rich in iron ore), the Schmitt (in the Zeltingen Schlossberg), and the Anrecht (in the Zeltingen Himmelreich) are all old parcels high on their respective slopes and post trained on their original rootstock. Typically, Auslese is selected by successive passes through the vineyard—picking fruit for Kabinett and Spätlese first and leaving the healthiest berries on the vine to concentrate. For the en-bloc wines selection of this type is avoided, in order to maintain a holistic flavor profile that contains that of ultra-ripe grapes, optimally ripe, and of lesser-ripe ones which has the ability to reflect a complete terroir of both place and moment. Because his approach in winemaking is minimal, Johannes Selbach will allow his wines to ferment naturally, as slow or as complete as manifest, resulting in dry wines in some vintages and fruity in others.

Those ancient cellars will now be used to age Argiano's most important bottles. This property has a famously well-stocked cellar with more than 3,000 bottles, including prized vintages from Bordeaux and a retrospective of Chateau d'Yquem that starts with the 1927 vintage. The main water well has been restored into a vertical wine cellar, and there is a corner dedicated to the signature wines of the late consultant Giacomo Tachis who worked at Argiano for many years. General Manager Bernardino Sani says that the ideal growing conditions in 2015 led to the first official 100%-organic vintage at the estate. Argiano is positioned between 280 and 300 meters above sea level.

Light and fresh on the palate with hints of white peach, the wine is medium sweet with an excellent acid balance, a silky texture and a clean, long and crisp finish. Shortly after the start of the new millennium, the genuine shortage of aszú (botrytis) harvests and the limited volumes even in those vintages led us to explore other opportunities. We researched ways of producing more accessible, but equally vibrant, wines of around 100 g/L (equivalent to a 4 puttonyos sweetness). Rather than selecting individual berries shriveled by botrytis, Late Harvest relies on partial bunch selection, which naturally includes ripe, overripe and botrytised berries. This combination of different ripening stages of the berries inside the bunch gives a distinctive Tokaji character but does not require the long ageing of aszú wines. The harvested clusters are then pressed and the rich must fermented in the same manner as the dry wines, maintaining a balance of sugar and natural acidity. The Late Harvest spends about three months in barrels, using some new casks. As with all Royal Tokaji wines, quality, house style and balance is the focus.

117421,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Red,14.5,Cork,"Like most families in the Langhe, the Giamellos started out with a polyculture estate that included small parcels of vines, grain, forest, and pastures where their animals grazed. The bulk of the grape harvest was sold off, but the family made enough wine for their own consumption. This system continued for three generations until the 1950s, when farm life became less profitable and many families left the area to find factory work in the cities. Brothers Luigi and Ercole Giamello stayed but launched a trucking company to supplement their income—the first motorized transportation service in the area—and in their absence their mother took care of the daily vineyard work, wisely replanting much of their land to vines. When the economy improved in the ‘70s Luigi was able to return to the domaine full-time, focusing more on wine production and eventually passing the reins to his son and daughter-in-law, Silvio Giamello and Marina Camia. This fourth generation continues to make wine the only way they can imagine: all vineyard work is natural and chemical-free, and the vinification techniques are purely traditional. La Licenziana remains the archetypal artisanal estate, with very small quantities produced entirely by the family. When clients come to visit, Silvio humbly presents the wines, and his two young sons invariably burst into the winery with their mother following close behind, then gently leading them back into the house after greeting the guests. The Giamellos often finish tastings by blowing us away with an older vintage from their tiny personal stock. There’s no mistaking it: this is the real thing—old-fashioned Barbaresco with the terroir shining through.

He prefers to keep to himself, spending most of his time with his family in his modest, tasteful home, surrounded by his vineyards in the Sauternes and Graves appellations. Roûmieu-Lacoste, situated in Haut Barsac, originates from his mother’s side of the family, dating back to 1890. He also owns Château Graville-Lacoste and Château Ducasse, where he grows grapes for his Graves Blanc and Bordeaux Blanc, respectively. In the words of Dixon Brooke, “Hervé is as meticulous a person as I have encountered in France’s vineyards and wineries. Everything is kept in absolutely perfect condition, and the wines showcase the results of this care – impeccable.” Hervé is incredibly hard on himself. Despite the pedigree and complexity of the terroir and the quality of the wines, he has never been quite satisfied to rest on his laurels, always striving to outdo himself. This is most evident in his grape-sorting process for the Sauternes. Since botrytis is paramount to making great Sauternes, he employs the best harvesters available, paying them double the average wage to discern between the “noble rot,” necessary to concentrate the sugars for Sauternes, and deleterious rot. Hervé is so fastidious that he will get rid of a whole basket of fruit if a single grape with the harmful rot makes it in with healthy ones to be absolutely sure to avoid even the slightest contamination. Another thing that we love about Hervé is that he would rather entrust the selling to us than be away from his vines, so he lets us buy the lion’s share of his production.

Here, in this petite AOC, only one style of wine is produced: Méthode Ancestrale Rosé Demi-Sec. Perinet employed his deep experience, strong work ethic and exacting standards to create a slightly different version of this classic sparkling rosé. Most producers in Cerdon use predominately Gamay grapes and high sulfur, resulting in extreme sweetness. Since his first vintage in 2013, Perinet has worked organically. The blend, 80% of 100-year-old Poulsard and 20% of 40-year-old Gamay, is vinified and bottled without the addition of sulfur. Instead, Perinet has mastered controlling the temperature during fermentation and winemaking, allowing him to produce one the purest examples of Cerdon du Bugey that we have ever tasted.

Pierre is omnipresent in the vineyards from pruning to bud- break to harvest, offering his expertise in organic and biodynamic agriculture while working tirelessly with vineyard managers to oversee the plots destined to become his signature Cote d'Or and Mâconnais wines. Master of Wine Clive Coates once wrote that a feature of Meurgey wines is the total absence of a Meurgey Signature. In a region where 'terroir' is paramount, this may be one of the highest compliments one can receive and a testament to the value of preserving a sense of place as opposed to a homogenized, 'cookie-cutter' winemaking style. Pierre's purist philosophy has evolved even further at Meurgey-Croses with the sovereign belief that the Maconnais and its individually unique regions will be home to an entirely new and soulful renaissance of White Burgundy production.

120223,France,Languedoc,Red,14.0,Cork,"Attaining cult wine status is not an easy feat, and certainly not when the odds are stacked against you. Laurent Vaillé has achieved what others thought impossible. Having spent his early career training under such masters as Jean-François Coche-Dury (Meursault), Gérard Chave (Hermitage), and Eloi Durrbach (Domaine Trévallon, Provence), he settled in the l’Hérault of the Languedoc and purchased his own land in 1989, near Aniane. In this area of the region, where the limestone is hard and abundant and the soil poor, no one thought he would ever have any success planting a vineyard on his plot of choice. Though it took dynamite and bulldozing to clear twice the amount of limestone, boulders, and glacial scree that is found in neighboring vineyards, he found a great terroir for his grapes. He did not have to look far to find ideal bud wood, either. He sourced his Syrah, Marsanne, and Roussane cuttings from Gérard Chave and his Cabernet from Domaine Trévallon. Laurent’s South-facing vines get very low yields, normally from twenty to twenty-five hectoliters per hectare. All are pruned in the gobelet style. The simultaneous restraint and power of his wines makes them ideal for aging. As for the skeptics, they are currently eating their words. His area of the Languedoc has since become known to produce some of the greatest wines in the region, with the new appellation of Terrasses du Larzac, of which he is technically part, reaping attention and praise. In his words, “Nature gave us a partition of land. It is up to us to interpret it.”

Around the turn of the century, Andreas Jordan elevated quality winemaking in Pfalz by becoming one of the first growers in the area to plant single varieties by vineyard and was also one of the first winemakers to vinify each vineyard separately. A marriage between the Bassermann and Jordan families added the name Bassermann to the winery in 1883.

119607,Mosel,Mosel,White,10.0,Cork,"Joh. Jos. Prüm needs no introduction to Riesling lovers, having already become a Mosel icon during the nearly five decades during which its namesake’s son Sebastien was in charge. Katharina Prüm has been active alongside her father, Manfred, since early in the new millennium, and the two of them perpetuate a house style that has itself become a Mosel archetype: wines of delicacy and restrained sweetness, often strongly marked in youth by yeasty and otherwise fermentative aromas, and tingling with dissolved CO2. Their longevity is legendary, and the Prüms personally don’t care to drink their own wines – even the Kabinetts – with less than a dozen, and usually many more, years in bottle. The aromas of youthful Prüm wines make it obvious that fermentation here is entirely spontaneous. Manfred makes no secret of his longstanding disinterest in legally dry wines. These are uncompromising, benchmark Mosel wines. The Bernkasteler Badstube vineyard borders those of the Graacher Himmelreich on the latter’s southern edge. The slopes are on a marginally shallower gradient, with deeper soils than the Graacher and Wehlener, while the western orientation allows the vines longer exposure to the afternoon sun. The Badstube typically produces a wonderfully floral, delicate and mineral wine. Overall, the wines are usually slightly more delicate in structure and weight when compared with the wines of Graacher or Wehlener, but they are wonderfully racy and fine examples of the middle Mosel.""

The grape is so called supposedly because it was a favorite treat for flocks of sheep driven to lower pastures. Pecorino cheese is, coincidentally, a surprisingly good food match for Pecorino wine. And while it is true that the grape itself is thought to be very old, wines made from the Pecorino grape date only to about the 1990's. Like so many grapes that have teetered on the precipice of extinction, Pecorino’s low yields had seen it replaced with more productive varietals like Trebbiano. In the 1980's a local producer found some forgotten vines in an overgrown vineyard, he grafted them and set out to bring Pecorino back to life. The grapes can be naturally quite high in sugar, which may help explain their attractiveness for the wandering sheep, and the wines produced from them are frequently in excess of 13% abv.  Luckily, the grapes are also blessed with naturally high acidity which helps to keep the alcohol in balance. Illuminati's Pecorino is fragrant and rich in ripe fruit and white flower tones, almond, field herbs and citrus. It fills the mouth well, powerful and very persistent: a correct balance between structure and softness, thanks to freshness and sapidity that accompany the long finish. A wine of a good longevity.

120213,Ruwer,Ruwer,White,8.5,Cork,"The historic Karthäuserhof estate is located just before the confluence of the Ruwer and Mosel rivers, nestled along a side valley adjacent to the small village of Eitelsbach. Recent findings indicate that the spot was a settlement practicing viticulture as early as Roman times. Named Karthäuserhof, or “Farm of the Carthusians,” it was founded officially as a Carthusian monastery in the 11th century. In 1811, Napoleon secularized the region and the property was auctioned off in Paris. It was bought by Valentin Leonardy and, miraculously, through the trials and tribulations of over 200 years, has remained in the same family. The Tyrells inherited Karthäuserhof in the mid-20th century with their eldest son, Christoph, running all operations in the vineyard and cellar until 2012. 2015 marked the beginning of a new period in the estate’s history, as Ludwig Breiling, the legendary winemaker behind the successful 1990s and outstanding vintages of 2000 – 2009, returned from his absence to oversee all work in the winery and vineyards.  To complete his dream team, he called upon Sascha Dannhäuser to take on the role of head winemaker. In addition to working alongside Ludwig for over 20 years, Dannhäuser was a key asset to Christian Vogt during his tenure at the estate. The single-vineyard estate makes wines exclusively from the Karthäuserhofberg vineyard. They use no pesticides, instead preferring pheromones, which prevent insect pests from reproducing. The 19 hectares of vineyards are planted almost entirely to Riesling on original rootstock. While the estate produces the classic Prädikat wines, they have long been ahead of the curve and renowned for their dry Rieslings, an area of increasing popularity among Riesling lovers. In fact, the majority of their production is dry wines, including a Grosses Gewächs that was introduced with the 2009 vintage.

32829,Veneto,Prosecco,White,11.0,Cork,"Sisters Antonella and Ersiliana Bronca have steered their estate along the path of quality since taking over the reigns from their father Livio. Joined by Antonella’s husband, Pietro, a winemaker, and Ersiliana’s daughter Elisa, who has recently graduated with a degree in enology, this family team works hard in the vineyard and in the cellar to produce the purest Prosecco out there. The wine is classified as a Prosecco Colli Conegliano DOCG, the region having recently achieved DOCG status as of April 2010. In addition, many of their steep, hillside vineyards lie within the borders of the prized Valdobbiadene region. The fact that they straddle this border means that they are perfectly situated to produce quality red wines as well, wines that have earned them 3 glasses and much praise from the Gambero Rosso. In fact, this is one of the only Proseccos to ever be featured at the Gambero Rosso’s annual tour of Tre-Bicchieri winners, an honor the winery does not take lightly.<BR><BR>

Polaner Selections is thrilled to be representing this winery and to be offering their outstanding Prosecco Extra Dry, which the Gambero Rosso has described as “clearly defined, succulent and moreish” (which is apparently British English for something so delicious you have to eat or drink it). Work in the winery’s 20 hectares of vineyards is impeccable and the grapes are certified organic. In the cellar, techniques lean towards high-tech: As soon as the grapes are pressed, the pure must – primarily Prosecco with small amounts of the indigenous varieties Perera, Verdiso and Bianchetta – is brought down to freezing temperature, right at the point before the liquid starts to solidify. Preserved in this stasis, only the exact amount needed is extracted at the time of bottling (several bottlings are made per year), leaving the remaining must conserved in optimal condition while the base wine is returned to fermentation temperature and converted by “charmat” method (in tank) into the freshest, sparkling Prosecco possible. This method guarantees that all the original aromatics and fruit flavors of the grapes, featuring sweet pear, nectarine and white blossoms, are transferred in perfect condition to the finished wine. It is a truly stunning example of Italy’s favorite sparkler—perfect as an aperitif, with delicate dishes and fish, and for celebrating any special occasion."" -Importer",1494

It is truly rare today to discover vineyards that have literally never been subjected to any chemical pesticide or herbicide. Stroll through the vineyards at either Beauséjour or Langlais and you will quickly see that there is a complete and harmonious ecosystem in place. In the spring, each year, there are fragile tulips growing among the vines, a clear sign that there is balance and life in the soils. A blend of 80% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauv.

The Gran Reserva wines are only made in very exceptional vintages, in small quantities and from selected grapes. The number of bottles made varies from 5,000 to 15,000. They age in barrel for a minimum of 8 years to a maximum of 10 and some of them are hand racked over 20 times.

Once the home of some of the world’s most sought after and expensive wines, the region fell to mediocrity in the years following the Second World War. Josi has made it his life’s work to reclaim the intrinsic quality of his native terroir and introduce the world to the true potential of the Rheingau. “Lay” is a very old word meaning slate and ""Kloster"" is the German translation of Abbey. The slate found here is ancient—predating the Devonian period—and similar to the crumbly, soft grey slate found in the Rottland. Josi believes this site is destined for a fruity style and therefore always makes Kabinett from this vineyard. Clear and precise on the nose where ripe Riesling flavors intertwine with some earthy mineral tones, the light yet full-flavored palate is surprisingly pure and offers a lingering piquant, racy and elegant Riesling Kabinett full of terrior-driven character and finesse.

On the palate the wine is deep, full-bodied and snappy, with a great core of fruit, bright acids, great focus, very fine mousse and exceptional grip on the very long, minerally and intensely flavored finish.

""Laurence Ployez is a third-generation winemaker at her family's estate, which was established in 1930. Ployez-Jacquemart owns 2.15 hectares of Premier Cru and Grand Cru vineyards in Ludes and Mailly-Champagne in the Montagne de Reims, known for its classic chalk slopes. Laurence purchases Premier Cru and Grand Cru grapes from 12 hectares of vineyards from growers that the family has worked with for over 20 years. All of the work in the vineyards is done by hand, from the beginning of the growing season until the grapes are harvested. Only first press juice goes into the Ployez-Jacquemart wines. A light filtration is used for wines produced in vats, but no filtration is used on wines aged in wooden barrels. The wines undergo a very slow bottle fermentation in a 25 meter-deep cellar, giving them extremely fine bubbles. Wines are aged nose to punt, or sur pointe, in lieu of being aged on their side. Aging sur pointe provides the antioxidative and aging benefits of the lees while not allowing the wines to become too rich from the lees contact. When the wines are ready to be disgorged, after up to 12 years in the cellar, only a very minimal dosage is added, typically 3-4g/liter. Ployez-Jacquemart's goal is to leave the structure of each wine intact, allowing the true character and personality of the harvest to shine through. Unlike most producers in Champagne, she strives to keep the characteristic of each vintage even in her NV blends and only uses a very small amount of reserve wine, if any at all."" - <b>Importer</b>",1353

The wine is sourced from 4 terroirs: pebbly clay, sand, gravelly red clay and sandy limestone.<BR><BR>

Over the last quarter century, Domaine de la Janasse has become one of the most highly-regarded estates in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Led by siblings Christophe and Isabelle Sabon, the estate combines the best of both traditional and modern techniques to craft a collection of truly riveting wines from “simple” value-priced VDP’s to their benchmark Châteauneufs. The estate was founded in 1976 by Aimé Sabon, the father of Christophe and Isabelle, who still oversees the vineyards. The property consists of 40 hectares, spread over as many as 70 different parcels throughout the appellation. The terroirs range from sandy soils, as can be found in their well-known plots in the North of the appellation – Chapouin and La Janasse– to lightly-colored clay limestone soils and gravelly red clay and galets, most notable in their plots in Le Crau in the South. While Aimé works the vineyards organically, his children, Christophe and Isabelle, arxe in charge of wine production. Christophe is a self-proclaimed “great defender of Grenache,” which still represents 75% of their vines. With assistance from Aimé’s farming and Isabelle efforts in the cellar, he harnesses the typical exuberance of Grenache-based wines through careful vinifications that respect both terroir and vintage The results are a wide range of rich and flavorful Châteauneuf-du-Papes, Côtes-du-Rhônes and Vins de Pays that are complex and balanced – often in contradiction to an region better known for sheer size and power. The reds from Janasse are frequently considered to be among the best in the region whether it is their pleasingly complex Côtes-du-Rhone and Côtes-du-Rhône Villages or their three bottlings of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Not surprisingly the aptly named Tradition is the most reserved of their Châteauneufs while Chaupin and Vieilles Vignes are studies in contrast, between the purity of Grenache from sandy soil clearly evident in the former, to the intensity and power of the later – an indication of the age of the vines, the range of soils from which they are sourced and the density afforded by the addition of old-vine Syrah and Mourvedre to their centenary Grenache."" -Importer",1742

The white wines grow on steep loess terraces that characterize the landscape of the eastern part of the Kremstal. These terraces store heat during the day and reflect it onto the vines at night producing wines with unique fruity, fresh, and bright flavors. Erich’s liter bottling of Grüner Veltliner has steadily improved over the last decade. It’s a perfect foil for the infectious drinkability that this variety is known for but has an extra level of clarity and complexity that is sometimes missing from this category. Fermented entirely in stainless steel from estate grown. Loess dominated vineyards in the Kremstal.

It became organic in 1964 under Paul Bouron who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and, despite being given all requisite medical treatments, had been told by the hospital doctors he was going to die. Paul stopped using conventional treatments on the family’s vines, cereal crops and herd of beef cattle, adopted the Lemaire-Boucher form of organic farming and, in 1964, became one of the founders of Nature et Progrès (the first association of consumers and producers actively promoting the development of organic and bio-dynamic practices). His son Daniel ran the domaine until his death in 2014. The Bouron family then sold Château de Chavrignac to Gérard Lobre whose family has been involved in wine in the region since 1734. Today, the domaine has 32 hectares of vines between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, 60 kms from the town of Bordeaux.

The excellent micro-climate and the deep slate soils of the Brauneberg hillside yield some of the most intensely flavored and elegantly-structured Riesling wines of the Mosel region. Oliver Haag rigorously selects the clones most suited to the microclimate of his vineyards in order to achieve the maximum potential in the grapes. His wines, which display a pleasing subtle color, show a well-defined palate that reaches from honeysuckle to pears and apples.

Helmut Dönnhoff has been making the wine since 1966, and now his son Cornelius is the 4th generation to run this historic winery and their 25 hectares of Erste Lage, or grand cru vineyards. Their holdings represent some of the best in the Nahe and all of Germany. This is from two main vineyards Oberhauser Felsenberg (volcanic) and Kieselberg (slate) as well as declassified fruit from the Grand Cru sites and Klamm, a new acquisition, a hectare in the (Niederhäuser) Klamm which we know from Jakob – it’s a mélange of slate and weathered porphyry, and has both steep and flat sections.

Dubois’ philosophy in the cellar is to produce wines with as little human interference as possible, native fermentation, no pumping, light extraction, no added sulfites (except for the white).

""Schiavenza is located in Serralunga d'Alba in the heart of Piedmont's Langhe district, celebrated for its great Barolo vineyards. The estate was founded in 1956 by the brothers Vittorio and Ugo Alessandria; the estate and surrounding area were formerly part of the Opera Pia Barolo (a castle that is kind of like the Hospices du Beaune: part educational institution and part hospital) whose vineyards were traditionally worked by sharecroppers. The local dialect for sharecropper is schiavenza. Today, the estate is run by the second-generation Alessandria sisters, Enrica and Maura, and their husbands Luciano Pira and Walter Anselma. Their holdings include 9.2 hectares in Serralunga with a small 0.5ha plot in Monforte d’Alba, and include the heralded crus Prapò, Cerretta, and Broglio.   For the last 19 years, they have also run Trattoria Schiavenza, right in the middle of the village of Serralunga, where their traditional fare draws in both local winemakers and tourists.  In the vineyard, they do not use pesticides or herbicides. Harvest is manual and is conducted according to the phases of the moon.  In the cellar, they use only naturally occurring yeasts, and ferment the wines in cement cisterns. In terms of aging, this is no modern barrique-aged Barolo estate: the wines here are aged for extended period of time in the traditional large Slovenian barrels called botti.  Tasting the three crus side by side, one realizes what Schiavenza is all about.  All three crus are on the east side of the Serralunga ridge, so exposures are all same, to the southeast.  Yields are more or less the same.  Cellar treatment (fermentation, length of maceration, vessel, and length of aging) is all the same.  The differences one feels have only to do with the variations in cru and vintage.  The quality here is shockingly good.

I know that it’s impossible to smell the sensation of saltiness, but the nose of our Picpoul is maritime, coupled with a discreet suggestion of peaches, wildflowers and the (we really can’t help it, but it’s in there) ubiquitous fragrance of beeswax. This wine is utterly brilliant with the briniest oysters you can find or Dungeness crab. Impressively bracing natural acidity (no acidification was doon), with echoes of the ocean. Beeswax Vineyard, in Arroyo Seco, is after all, only a hop, skip and jump away from the cool breezes of Carmel.

The name itself stands for so much: the family, the wines, a style, a tradition, a way of doing things. After all the time, effort, patience, and care that go into the making of a bottle of Quintarelli, it truly does mean so much more than wine. Giuseppe, fondly known as “Bepi” to those closest to him, was a perfectionist in every way. From the beautiful handwritten labels, to the best possible quality cork, to the exquisite wine in the bottles, the Quintarelli name is a stamp of authenticity and the ultimate indication of an artisanal, handmade, uncompromising wine of the highest quality. Nothing is ever hurried at Quintarelli. The wines take their time and are given the time they need. In the still, quiet calm of the family cellars above the town of Negrar, along the winding via del Cerè, deep in the Valpolicella zone, the wine from the family’s hillside vineyards ages patiently and gracefully in large casks until it is ready. Every release is a masterpiece, a testament to time, tradition, skill, and passion, the creations of a master artisan. You can’t really compare these wines to any other in the region, or anywhere else in the world. They really are in a class and a category all their own. Multiple passages through the vineyards produce a myriad of wines, many produced using the appassimento technique whereby the grapes are dried on rush mats before being pressed and made into wine. From the delicious and seductive Bianco Secco, to the benchmark Valpolicella that created a revolution in the thinking about what it was possible to produce in this region, to the Rosso del Bepi and Amarones produced according to the quality of the harvest, to the otherworldly Recioto and the exceedingly rare Bandito, the sheer artistry and depth of the range is truly exceptional.

<b>About Gruet</b><br>
Gilbert Gruet, founder of Gruet Winery, was born in Bethon, France in 1931. He grew up in a poor family, and began working at a young age. In 1952, Gilbert Gruet, along with his wife Danielle, dreamt of producing fine quality Champagne. Gilbert followed his heart and in 1967 created the U.V.C.B. (Union Vinicole des Coteaux de Bethon), a co-op in the village of Bethon.  In 1983, the Gruet Family was traveling through the southwestern part of the US, and while in New Mexico met a group of European winemakers who had successfully planted vineyards in Engle, near the town of Truth or Consequences, 170 miles south of the city of Albuquerque. After hearing of vineyards planted there as early as the 1600s, and learning about the specific climate and soil conditions of the region, the Gruet Family knew they had found what they were looking for. In 1984, Gilbert Gruet – whose Champagne house (Gruet et Fils) has produced fine Champagnes in Bethon, France since 1952 – made the decision to plant an experimental vineyard in Engle, NM. The plantings were exclusively Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes. Two of his four children, Laurent and Nathalie Gruet then relocated to New Mexico to begin their American winemaking adventure.",1777

109232,Champagne,Champagne,White,12.0,Cork,"The base wine for this Old Vines Champagne comes from the Grand Cru vineyards of Pierre Robert Haut» «Tarclette» and «Varmery».
The vines are on average 65 years old, which is important for the selection of the plots, as each plant produces a third less than a younger plant. Hence a higher aromatic potential and an optimum maturity at harvest time. The primary aromas are typical of a Pinot Noir from Aÿ: blackcurrant, small red fruit, in the nose and on the palate, with a spicy note at the end of the tasting. These aromas have evolved with the second fermentation, dominated now by juicy fruit, such as white peach and stewed lemon.

The wine displays a deep purple hue with a dark garnet halo. Rich aromas of hibiscus reduction, toasted cedar bark, raspberry compote, wild violet, and eucalyptus oil emerge in waves. The palate experience is noticeably darker suggesting notes of bittersweet dark chocolate, star anise, macerated blackberries, spearmint, flint, and baking spices. The trajectory of this wine is absolutely seamless, and the tannin so finely integrated it drinks more like a wine that has already been cellared for 5-7 years.

118082,Niederosterreich-Lower Austria,Niederosterreich,White,12.5,Screwtop,"Martin and Anna are the rarest of purists. They are iconoclasts – totally uncompromising in their methods- yet they eschew dogma in favor of open-mindedness and curiosity. Both Martin and Anna come from a long line of winemakers (Anna is from the Steininger family), and their travels before taking over Martin’s family winery were incredibly formative. This, paired with their already strong and creative personalities, caused them to break sharply with tradition when they came back home and forge their own path together. In a short amount of time, Arndorfer has become one of the brightest stars in the natural wine world and an icon of the next generation of Austrian winemakers. Martin and Anna believe that a profound wine must be a pleasure to drink and a pleasure to make, and it shows in the wines. You can tell that they’re having fun. Their aim is to carry the “message from the vineyard” in its fullest form, and the path is minimalism in the cellar – meaning nothing added and nothing taken away. More specifically, this means no sulfur at crushing, no fining of the must, no adding yeast or even a pied de cuve, no stopping malolactic, no cold stabilization, the very gentlest if any filtering, and no additions beyond minuscule levels of sulfur added at bottling. Especially in Austria, a lot of producers consider this quite risky, but Martin & Anna aren’t concerned by this because they believe their wines develop their own microbial stability through a lack of manipulation. Strasser Weinberge is a protected name for “village wines“ which show you all characteristics of the variety and the village. Grapes are selected from the best vineyard sides in the village and express the diversity and complexity of the origin. Sourced from 4 different vineyards; Strasser Gaisberg on loess soil with primary rock subsoil, Strasser Wechselberg on heavy dark clay soil with high amount of chalk, Strasser Hasel on deep loess soil, and Strasser Stangl on deep loess soil. They are all south facing terraces with altitudes between 214 - 330 meters planted between 1959 and 2000. Whole punch pressing, no maceration before pressing.

Some of you may know the story of a bottle of Condrieu that my dear friend Dan Stromberg brought to our mutual birthday celebration while we were both attending viticulture/enology school.  At wine school, that sort of thing counts as studying, and we were both very diligent students.

Beyond the name on the bottle, I knew nothing about Condrieu- never even heard of it.  A year later I was living in that tiny village- the homestead of Viognier, helping with harvest.  While it all happened pretty fast, it wasn’t as easy as it sounds.   As the recipient of a French wine studies scholarship, I had the opportunity to go just about anywhere I wished- so long as I worked for free, and didn’t complain (perfect criteria for anyone wishing to start their own winery).  Everything was going great until I asked for a ‘post’ in Condrieu.  Nobody in Condrieu ‘wanted’ me.  Not even for free!  The short version is that the region had been in decline for decades and was just beginning to get back on its feet.  The handful of growers who remained in the appellation were xenophobic; afraid that I would plant a bunch of Viognier back home and overburden the market.  I want to stress that these folks were simply, and understandably scared.  They had worked for decades hoping their appellation could re-emerge while teetering on the edge of extinction.  While I could empathize, I was feeling a bit of youthful frustration. I argued that it was really in their best interests to help me.  Just about no one in the U.S. had heard of Condrieu.  The only way to tell the story of Viognier is to tell the story of Condrieu.  If my wine caught folks’ attention, the next wine they would try would likely be from Condrieu.  This plea resonated for one grower, who upon promise of anonymity, agreed to let me work at his place. My assertion that sharing information and showcasing Viognier, along with other Rhone varieties, would be beneficial to us all wasn’t just the voice of desperation.  This sentiment was, and is, in my soul and prompted me to co-found and promote Hospice du Rhone.  In 2005, about 20 years after I pled my way into a job in Condrieu, the producers of that appellation and its neighbor- Cote Rotie, honored me as a Decurion.  A sort of citizen for life in recognition of the attention and acclaim I helped bring to the region.  It was one of the most humbling and unanticipated moments of my life."" -Winery",1782

The winery continues to utilize organic winegrowing and has benefited from the fact that the monks of Zwettl Monastery began these practices as early as 1958. For this wine, the grapes are from the best sites around the Heiligenstein (Lamm, Grub and Renner). The Grüner Veltliner is grown in young vineyards (under 20 years old) of the former Steiner Allerheiligenstiftung, a religious foundation that dates back to 1171.

For over a decade, Olivier had tasked himself with sourcing and making wine from the best sites within Pouilly-Fuissé and bottling them under his own label. After buying grapes from Clos des Quarts for several vintages, he was one of the first approached with the news that it was for sale. Having been already convinced of the terroir's integrity he jumped on the opportunity. The vineyard is located in Chaintré, the southernmost village of Pouilly-Fuissé. At just over 2 hectares, the oldest vines are almost a century old and are planted on clay-limestone soils. The Clos des Quarts is currently planted to 2.23 hectares of old vines. A further 40 ares can and will be planted. The Clos is located inside the Quarts vineyard where it occupies the upper part of the slope. The ferruginous topsoil is shallow there and the bedrock below it is Bajocian crinoidal limestone, forming a similar terroir to that of Chambertin, Clos de Bèze, as well as parts of Romanée-Saint-Vivant and the Clos de Vougeot. The Clos is a true clos with all but a few meters of its great wall not standing. This is of more than symbolic importance. Topsoil washed downslope by erosion remains trapped at the bottom of the vineyard by the walls. If soil was ever replaced at the top of the Clos, it is more than likely that it has always come from the Clos itself. The Clos faces due east and is planted at a higher density than is habitual in the Mâconnais, 10,000 vines per hectare rather than 6,500 to 8,000."" - Distributor

Under Thomas’ expert guidance, Outpost grapes are harvested late in the season – by hand, at dawn – to preserve the full intensity and distinctive spicy character of the mountain fruit. The grapes are processed with as little manipulation as possible. Grapes from each block within the vineyard are fermented separately so that our winemaking team can be very selective about the lots that comprise the final blend.

Also named in 2009 by Wine & Spirits Magazine “the best Austrian winemaker of the last 25 years,” Willi Bründlmayer farms 90 hectares of Grüner Veltliner, Riesling, St. Laurent, Zweigelt and Burgundian varieties from an impressive collection of grand cru vineyards around Langenlois. In 2016, Andreas Wickhoff MW joined the estate and as general manager works alongside Willi in all aspects. As of 2019, Bründlmayer is certified organic by LACON, an outside, objective, certifying body. During harvest, multiple selections through the vineyard are made, as botrytis is never accepted. Grapes are never de-stemmed or crushed, and they are handled as minimally as possible. A tiny portion of grapes are held back, de-stemmed, and macerated for 12 hours; Willi uses these as ‘seasoning’ during blending to add another dimension and tonality to the final wines. The Gruner Veltliner 'Terrassen' is lightning clean with hay flowers, fine spice, echo of green nuts, zest and apple peel; completely dry, but still juicy on the palate, firmly built, medium-bodied, good definition, light, subtle fruit aroma, with mineral notes in the gentle aftertaste.

In the vinification, Erich and Elisabeth use indigenous yeasts for all cuvées except in an occasional year for the spring-bottled wines. Because Erich has a vineyard of Blaufrankisch in the Südburgenland, they are not members of Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus. This gives Erich the flexibility, though, to do things in vinification that he feels are more natural, and indeed he is very proud that they use no additives like finings in their wines and keeping their wines sometimes on the fine lees with very low SO2 for up to a year.

One of the oldest family-owned wineries in Austria, they were the first to export their wines to the United States in the 1930s and are founding members of the Traditionsweingüter Österreich, the group tasked with classifying Austria’s most important vineyards in a system resembling that of Burgundy. Salomon’s top vineyard sites, perched on south-facing terraces along the Danube River, are all designated Erste Lage ÖTW, or Grand Cru, which might please the Capuchin Monks who planted them should they have lived long enough to find out. Like their father, Bert Salomon Sr., Fay and Bert believe that great wines are made from living soils and don’t wear makeup.  The path to a beautiful bottle is through meticulous, environmentally conscious care in the vineyard and thoughtful work in the cellar. Cover crops are grown between rows to maintain vital soils and encourage biodiversity, and under-vine management is done manually, without the use of sprays (there has been no use of herbicides in more than a decade). Sheep’s wool is hung to repel hungry deer from the nearby forrest, and natural pheromones are used to prevent destruction by a local butterfly. The wine is handled gently in the cellar – not manipulated, but rather protected – as it reaches toward a pure expression of its time and place. The Salomons farm 30 hectares of vines in and around Stein in the Kremstal DAC, almost all of it Grüner Veltliner from deep loess soil and Riesling from primary rock terraces.

Prüm needs no introduction to Riesling lovers, having already become a Mosel icon during the nearly five decades during which its namesake’s son Sebastien was in charge. Katharina Prüm has been active alongside her father, Manfred, since early in the new millennium, and the two of them perpetuate a house style that has itself become a Mosel archetype: wines of delicacy and restrained sweetness, often strongly marked in youth by yeasty and otherwise fermentative aromas, and tingling with dissolved CO2. Their longevity is legendary, and the Prüms personally don’t care to drink their own wines – even the Kabinetts – with less than a dozen, and usually many more, years in bottle. The aromas of youthful Prüm wines make it obvious that fermentation here is entirely spontaneous. Manfred makes no secret of his longstanding disinterest in legally dry wines. These are uncompromising, benchmark Mosel wines. The Zeltinger Sonnenuhr vineyard is the most northernly site and directly borders the northern edge of the Wehlener Sonnenuhr. Both sites are named after the sundials (Sonnenuhr) that sit amongst the vines and that are clearly visible from the other side of the river. The Zeltinger Sonnenuhr has a similar sun exposition and steepness to its neighbor, but there is less top soil and the roots hit on the firm slate rock almost immediately. This means the vines have more trouble finding water which affects yields and the characteristics of the vines. Prüm’s parcel comes from a patch of 60-70 year old vines around the sundial. The wines can be very complex, with earthy, rocky and smoky notes. They can have a certain dense quality and their acidity often is lower. They perhaps do not achieve the same finesse as the wines from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr, but they are probably more complex and can deliver wonderful, mouth-filling pleasure nonetheless.

The terroir of their steep vineyard sites is generally fresh weathering grey slate with different compositions of ferruginous (Brauneberg), mineral quartz (Veldenz), or clay soils (Graach, Erden, Wehlen, Mülheim), which determine character and flavor.

The winery was founded in 1938 by Antonio Argiolas and was the first on the island to pursue quality over quantity. Today, the Argiolas family is recognized as Sardinia’s leading producer of wine. Sardinia is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean and lies roughly 190 miles west of Italy's mainland. The vineyards of Argiolas are located in Serdiana in the Trexenta hills just north of the capital of Cagliari. Argiolas farms 600 acres of native Sardinian grapes including Nuragus, Monica, and Cannonau. Perdera, meaning ""place of many stones,"" is made from Monica, a grape that grows exclusively on the island of Sardinia and gives soft, easy-drinking wines with ample fruitiness. Some experts believe that Monica came from Spain but a genetic link has yet to be found. Monica is widely planted, easy to drink, and is very popular in Sardinia. Perdera is 90% Monica, 5% Carignano, and 5% Bovale Sardo, aged in neutral barrels and cement vats to preserve Monica’s varietal characteristics. The wine shows red fruit aromas and flavors of cherries and plums with floral notes and spices. Perdera is juicy with bright acidity and low tannins."" - Importer",272

Grüner Veltliner is predominantly grown on the mineral-rich loess soils south and west of Langenlois; besides the original family vineyards of the late 19th-century in Thal, parcels include Erste Lage vineyards in Kittmannsberg, Käferberg and in Schenkenbichl, a distinct and special soil, where the vines are grown on amphibolite rock. One of the most famed and best crus in Austria, the Heiligenstein vineyard is a unique geological formation within Europe; a geological island. The old vines grow on a complex sedimentary soil structure, on sandstone conglomerate with red arkoses and volcanic quartz porphyries. The narrow terraces yield a highly complex Riesling with a strong personality.

120146,Roussillon,Corbieres,White,13.5,Cork,"Certified Organic in 1996, but practicing organic since 1984, Château Pech Latt is one of the early Corbières vineyards to capitalize on their terroir. Situated near the idyllic town of Lagrasse, the vineyard is 130 hectares (320 acres) of beautiful land, bounded by hills on 3 sides, and divided into parcels, each planted with a specific grape. With its natural spring, Pech Latt’s grape-growing pedigree can be traced back almost 2,000 years. The estate also preserved the old vines of Carignan, which have been systematically removed by other estates, so the character of the wine is greatly influenced by up to 40% of these 60+ year old vines depending on the vintage.""

It was not until 1958 however, when Arturo’s son, Giancarlo, established the eponymous Travaglini Estate Winery. It was Giancarlo who recognized a greater potential in Gattinara and executed groundbreaking changes in his vineyards and cellar, unseen before in the appellation. For example, he pioneered research into improving viticultural methods, such as high density planting (up to 5,000/HA), 100% hand-harvesting and Guyot vine training; today commonly practiced throughout the Appellation. His passion for Nebbiolo helped raise the profile of Gattinara, a commitment that has been carried on through the generations. The Gattinara best expresses the classic qualities of the appellation; it is a wine with marked minerality and complexity. Deep ruby red in color with garnet reflections. On the nose, aromas of red fruit, blackberry, plum and licorice with hints of vanilla and leather.

Led by siblings Christophe and Isabelle Sabon, the estate combines the best of both traditional and modern techniques to craft a collection of truly riveting wines from ""simple"" value-priced VDP’s to their benchmark Chateauneufs. The estate was founded in 1976 by Aime Sabon, the father of Christophe and Isabelle, who still oversees the vineyards. The property consists of 40 hectares, spread over as many as 70 different parcels throughout the appellation. The terroirs range from sandy soils, as can be found in their well-known plots in the North of the appellation – Chapouin and La Janasse– to lightly-colored clay limestone soils and gravelly red clay and galets, most notable in their plots in Le Crau in the South. While Aimé works the vineyards organically, his children, Christophe and Isabelle, arxe in charge of wine production. Christophe is a self-proclaimed “great defender of Grenache,” which still represents 75% of their vines. With assistance from Aimé’s farming and Isabelle efforts in the cellar, he harnesses the typical exuberance of Grenache-based wines through careful vinifications that respect both terroir and vintage The results are a wide range of rich and flavorful Châteauneuf-du-Papes, Côtes-du-Rhônes and Vins de Pays that are complex and balanced – often in contradiction to an region better known for sheer size and power. The reds from Janasse are frequently considered to be among the best in the region whether it is their pleasingly complex Côtes-du-Rhone and Côtes-du-Rhône Villages or their three bottlings of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Not surprisingly the aptly named Tradition is the most reserved of their Châteauneufs while Chaupin and Vieilles Vignes are studies in contrast, between the purity of Grenache from sandy soil clearly evident in the former, to the intensity and power of the later – an indication of the age of the vines, the range of soils from which they are sourced and the density afforded by the addition of old-vine Syrah and Mourvedre to their centenary Grenache."" -Importer",556

Vintage & Viticulture: The season began with a memorable amount of rainfall, which was a refreshing change after five years of drought conditions, but also included more triple-digit heat waves in the summer months. The weather during the mid-harvest season cooled a bit & included some late foggy mornings. These cooler mornings allowed for a longer growing season for later-ripening varietals like Cabernet Sauvignon & Petit Verdot, giving them longer on the vine. This additional hang time markedly slowed sugar accumulation & ripening, ultimately producing deep, alluring, finesse-driven wines"".

116999,South Island,Marlborough,White,13.0,Cork,"Muritai is located a half mile from the sea in one of the windiest and driest spots in Marlborough. Whilst bud-break is 7-10 days earlier here because of the proximity of a relatively warm sea in the spring, in the summer the breeze is stronger in the Awatere than elsewhere in Marlborough. And it’s strongest where we are, close to the sea. More wind makes our vines less prone to disease, reducing the need for treatments. Wind also reduces temperature, lowering yields and delaying maturity so the grapes see more of the cooler fall evenings. The cool evenings mean larger diurnal temperature changes as well as longer hang times, both of which help develop the aromas and flavors that give our wines their unique intensity. The soil at Muritai overlays gravel and clay. It’s the right kind of almost stone free clay that holds water, making it available to the vine’s root system in our drier micro-climate. The depth of the underlying clay and its water content vary from one end of the vineyard to the other, giving us the variable growing conditions we were seeking.

FLAVORS: Once imbibed an explosion of blueberries with freshly squeezed lemon are obvious.

How weirdly satisfying is that combination?

The vines are trained in a special way on pergola (known as “tupin” in local dialect) to obtain maximum exposure to the sun in this high altitude district and are planted to soils that are dominated by slate. The appellation of Carema is extremely small: only 16 hectares (approximately 40 acres) are planted to the vine. The Ferrando family controls 2.5 hectares of the appellation. The Nebbiolo grapes are harvested normally during the second half of October; then, they undergo a cuvaison of approximately two weeks in stainless steel before being racked into a mixture of large and small barrels for an extensive aging period of 30 to 36 months before being bottled (without filtration).  By law, the Carema cannot be released before four years of aging. Production of the Carema “Etichetta Bianca” is approximately 7200 bottles per annum, two-thirds of which (4800 bottles) comes to the States.

Hacienda El Indiano is a small production wine produced from old vines tended throughout the different Rioja subzones (Rioja Alta, Alavesa and Baja). The greatest virtue of el Indiano is the fact that it blends the climatic and grape diversity of Rioja, resulting in a wine that shows consistent quality year after year. in short, Haciando el Indiano is a blend of blends. La Rioja Alavesa and la Rioja Alta, located closer to the mountains, are at slightly higher elevations and have a cooler climate. La Rioja Baja to the southeast is drier and warmer. In Rioja producers seek acidity/freshness in Alavesa, tannins/structure in Alta and riper sweeter fruit in Rioja Baja. If Rioja was restricted to one climate, Rioja will also be restricted to fewer grapes, hurting its blending capacity which ultimately affects its consistency to produce top quality wines year after year. As with the finest red wines of Burgundy, Bordeaux or Piedmont, Hacienda El Indiano bears the distinct and unmistakable stamp of this terruño (terroir) from which it comes from. With great clarity and precision, it sings the music of its specific birthplace.

It is 100% Garnacha from local clones that the Lopez de Lacalle family has been farming since 1996. The principles remain the same: each can starts with the obsession for the careful cultivation of each individual vine, never using fertilizers or synthetic chemicals. The careful selection of each grape by hand. The gentle pressing by gravity to extract the juice combined with the natural transformation of native yeast evolving into delicious rosé.

It is also the only village with the right to produce a Grand Cru Pinot Noir still red wine.<br><Br>

""Dating from the 17th Century, the families of Barnaut and Tornay have been intimately involved in champagne production; the tradition being handed down through the generations. Both families have been based in Bouzy, a village with a distinguished tradition of champagne making since the early 1600s. Following his marriage to Mrs Simone Barnaut, Mr Bernard Tornay became the sole successor to Mr Gaston Barnaut (his father-in-law). The domaine is now 23 hectares: 5.5 hectares are planted with Chardonnay, the rest is Pinot Noir. 15 hectares are Grand cru level, 3 to 4 hectares 1er Cru level and the rest is sold in bulk. Around 8330 cases are produces each year. ""The Champagne region is characterized by its chalky sub-soil, whose porous nature serves to promote grape maturity by stocking and then re-distributing heat, and acts as a reservoir from which the vines can survive the driest summers. The minerality of this chalky substrate imparts a particular expression to the grape. The vines are worked according to the precepts of culture raisonnee, with minimum use of pesticides and fungicides. Grass is allowed to grow between vine rows and harvesting is entirely manual.

Aromas of dried herbs, cedar, clove & lavender join flavors of dark red fruit led by figs, black cherry, currants, boysenberry, huckleberry, raspberry, & evident oak spice are joined with more traditional Knights Valley tones of black olive, wild sage & mocha chocolate. Fine acidity & balance with an elegant structure lead to a lingering, memorable finish. VINEYARD NOTES: Located 17 miles northwest of the winery, Knights Valley vineyard is approximately 600 acres, & has rocky, well-drained soils that are perfectly suited to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec & Petit Verdot.
VINTAGE NOTES: The 2017 vintage provided high quality thanks to lower than average yields. The year began with abundant rainfall. Spring weather was mild, resulting in extended flowering in some areas with little shatter. Vines were vigorous thanks to the winter rains. A freak hail storm passed through quickly in June causing isolated damage. Three heat events, including one over Labor Day weekend, kicked harvest into high gear, dehydrating some grapes by early September. Cool weather arrived immediately afterward, allowing sugar levels to return to normal. Most late-ripening red grapes continued to hang on the vine & were picked throughout October.
WINEMAKING NOTES: To maintain the unique characteristics of the different lots from varying areas of the vineyard, each is monitored carefully through the vinification & aging process. Extended maceration created larger tannins to enhance the lush mouthfeel of the blend & extracted a maximum of color, aromas & flavors. The wines were then aged in French oak barrels (27% new) for 20 months & underwent malolactic fermentation for further development of texture & mouthfeel.",538

46095,Savoie,Bugey Cerdon,Rose,8.0,Cork,"90% Gamay, 10 % Poulsard. Pet-Nat.  Bugey is one of the best-kept secrets of France. As a geographical crossroads between the Savoie, the Jura, Burgundy, and the Rhone, it is one of the few regions where one can see both palm trees and snow within eyeshot. It is adjacent to the Savoie on its western side, located in between Lyon, Grenoble, and Geneva. The wines of Bugey were first cultivated here by the Romans and were later resuscitated by the medieval monks. Still, the region had to wait until 2009 before receiving its own A.O.C. status. Today, Cerdon is considered one of three crus within the appellation of Bugey, and the only one whose entire production consists of sparkling wine. In La Cueille, one of seven high-altitude hamlets surrounding the historic medieval town of Ponsin, Patrick and Catherine Bottex are farming the limestone slopes above the Ain River. They have been working five hectares of land since 1991 and produce only a small quantity of their beautiful, intriguing sparkling wine. As a former part of the Duchy of Burgundy, it stands to reason that several Burgundian grape varietals have found a home here—not the least of which is Gamay. The Bottex’s blend consists of ninety percent Gamay and ten percent of the native Poulsard. They bottle this low-alcohol wine using the methode ancestrale, a rare technique that experts believe predates the méthode champenoise. The wine first goes through a primary fermentation in cuve, but is then bottled before all of the residual sugar has converted to alcohol. After going through a secondary fermentation in the bottle for at least two months, the wine is ready—Champagne’s dosage is not permitted! The resulting wine is delightfully refreshing with bright fruit, a beautiful rosé hue, and a touch of sweetness.
Kermit had never heard of Bugey until Marcel Lapierre uncorked a beauty at one of his after-tasting parties. His best memory of drinking it, however, was from an ice chest at a hamburger barbecue on a beach in Hawaii. From Bugey to Waimanolo!"" -Importer",342

It is the result of an environmentally friendly, hand crafted method of production, which avoids the use of chemicals and irrigation. This rich, palatable wine has spent 14 months in American and European oak plus an additional 12 months aging in the bottle. Intense red ruby color. It has a refined and lasting aroma as the result of its aging in toasted oak, showing notes of menthol, liquorice and roasted coffee. Perfectly balanced on the palate, this wine transmits a sensation of maturity and power. For the last 25 years Bodegas Valduero has been growing grapes in the Valdefinas Valley – the most highly regarded section of the D.O. of Toro. Over the years, Yolanda, the winemaker, has noticed that one particular vineyard of the 50 hectares that are farmed there produced the finest grapes year after year. The wines from that vineyard have always shown greater structure and depth than the larger portion of the total vineyard area. It is for this reason that Yolanda has experimented with wines created from these vines for the last few years. The results have been so spectacular that Yolanda has decided to create Finca Azaya, an estate bottled wine coming from this very special terroir. When famed winemaker Mariano Garcia decided to locate the famous Mauro winery in Tuedela de Duero instead of Ribera del Duero, much of the reason was due to his desire to make wines in a way that was not restricted by the more well-known D.O. In this way he was able to structure his wines in a style that was dictated by what the land gave him. In the same way Yolanda Viadero chose to separate the wine produced from a very special vineyard from the restrictions of the Toro D.O. In doing that, she recognized that too many of the wines of Toro have become so over-extracted that they don't represent what the D.O. is truly capable of producing. In this way, she has given us Finca Azaya. So unique are these wines and so special is the vineyard that Yolanda has decided to follow the designation of Vino De Pago instead of the broader D.O. Toro designation. ",102

120411,Niederosterreich-Lower Austria,Wachau,White,13.5,Screwtop,"Leo Alzinger is located in Unterloiben, just across the street from Knoll. Leo owns parcels in two of the great vineyards in this part of the river valley: Loibenberg and Steinertal. Loibenberg is a towering, terraced hillside, while the diminutive (5.5 hectare) Steinertal is hidden and maintains a cooler micro-climate. On the terraced vineyards of both sites, Riesling is cultivated on the higher, more primary rock rich parcels while Grüner Veltliner is cultivated on the lower, silty, loess based parcels. Harvest at Alzinger happens later than some of Leo’s neighbors in Unterloiben, something he attributes to old vines and the specific exposition of his parcels. The extra time on the vine doesn’t increase sugar levels, Leo says, but rather pushes physiological ripeness to greater balance. Alzinger crushes whole cluster with a short maceration, then allows the must to settle for 24 hours, dropping any green tannins out. Tasting the wines next to some of the other Wachau greats, it becomes apparent that elegance and pristine fruit is what Leo looks for in winemaking, rather than opulence. Alzinger’s wines are never forceful or assertive; they are instead amazingly sanguine and calmly transparent. The Mühlpoint vineyard is located on the slope of the Steinertal. While in the upper part of the influence of the mountain is still clearly felt and gneiss penetrates to the surface, the lower half is increasingly characterized by the level and continuously deeper loam layers. Aromatically, these factors are mainly noticeable through a pronounced spiciness.

they worked tirelessly to meet
that goal. It was thought that
their ambition to make quality
